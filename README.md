# Anthocyanins estimation in homogeneous bean landrace (*Phaseolus vulgaris L.*) using probabilistic representation and Convolutional Neural Networks 

The code corresponds to the experiments performed for the estimation of anthocyanins in landraces of homogeneous color.

# Instructions for use
- To use the code you will need to include the sample images in the path `src/images` 
- To add the anthocyanin concentrations you must include them inside the file `dbAnthocyanins.m` located in `src/anthocyanin/`
